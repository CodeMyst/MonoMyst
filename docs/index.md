MonoMyst is a game engine written in C#, .Net Standard so you can use it in any kind of projects (.Net Framework, .Net Core, Xamarin...).

It's written on top of [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net) for now but there are plans to write a custom Vulkan renderer (also in C#), you can check on the progress of that here: [MonoMyst.Vulkan](https://github.com/CodeMyst/MonoMyst.Vulkan) (it's going to be a **while** until you could do anything with it except open a black window).

To get started check out the [Tutorials](tutorials/ECS/Getting_Started_With_ECS.md) (W.I.P.) and the [Api Reference](api/index.md).
